/**
 * @title Abstract manageable contract that can be inherited by other contracts.
 * @notice Contract module based on Ownable which provides a basic access
 *         control mechanism, where there is an owner and a manager that can be
 *         granted exclusive access to specific functions.
 *
 *         The `owner` is first set by passing the address of the `initialOwner`
 *         to the Ownable constructor.
 *
 *         The owner account can be transferred through a two steps process:
 *         1. The current `owner` calls {transferOwnership} to set a
 *            `pendingOwner`.
 *         2. The `pendingOwner` calls {acceptOwnership} to accept the ownership
 *            transfer.
 *
 *         The manager account needs to be set using {setManager}.
 *
 *         This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the
 *         modifiers `onlyManager`, `onlyOwner` and `onlyManagerOrOwner`, which
 *         can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to the manager
 *         and/or the owner.
